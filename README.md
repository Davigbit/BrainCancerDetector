# Brain Cancer Detector
BCD is a classification AI capable of helping the diagnosis of brain cancer.

# What it does:
Our machine learning model looks at CT scans of suspected brain cancer patients and determines if they have a tumor or not. All this with a tested accuracy of 97%.

# How to use:
Dowload all files and run 'gui.py'. The last should deploy an interactive window requesting the submission of a CT scan image.
